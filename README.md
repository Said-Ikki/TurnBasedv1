# TurnBasedv1
Logic for first turn based style game

Features
- playable character with skills and basic attack
- has a functioning health bar for enemies, the player, and meter for performing skills
- turn order depends on speed for each character in the fight
- can fight multiple enemies at once
- easy to make new enemies and levels
- only 1 python file

Issues
- the code is a nightmare
- absolutely no erronious input checking
- only controls one character
- enemies are all copy/paste versions of eachother with varying stat points, no unique enemy skills
- the code for a unique boss (Don Cappuchino) is unintuitive and spaghetti nonsense
